                <p id="paragraph1"><br>This is not a love letter. Actually, you never really did like love letters so here we are. But alas, it has been almost two years since everything happened. We a lot of really good memories from those times. Hours of calling each other even though we were in vacation, working together in a class project that was extremely successful, walking together to your school service, taking the DCAT together, and a lot more. Those were one of the best times in a while. I hope you never forget the strawberry plant I gave you, I mean, how could you forget? If I remembered correctly, strawberries were your favorite. You were probably expecting a basket of strawberries or possibly some jam, but I was giggling my way home carrying a whole strawberry plant. In my defense, it was indeed funny thinking of giving a whole plant and it was considerably cheaper! You laughed so hard when you saw it questioning if I was serious, and I was. In hindsight, that wasn't the best of ideas as you were having trouble bringing it home. And when you did get home, your dad wasnt the most excited about the plant. But at least your mom liked it right? Sadly, for both of us, that was when everything started to go down hill.

                <p id="paragraph2"><br>Currently, I'm in DLSU and you're in UPD. We wanted to go the same schools, with the same preference too. However, you were always the better one in academics so you passed the UPCAT while I didn't. Going to a new school was exciting at first, but I missed the familiar faces. I bet you did too. I like to think that seeing your familiar face was the reason why I went to visit you a couple times in Diliman. Clearly, your campus was the more "beautiful" one. Trees everywhere, fresh air, and you reminding me of the school we used to go to. We walked together around the campus, grabbed food, and talked - a lot. We joked around a bit as we reconnected after months of not seeing each other. You even promised to tour me around the whole campus when I visit again. We definitely missed each other, but maybe not in the same way.

                <p id="paragraph3"><br>Did you have to choose the school over the course? You got the course you wanted in La Salle while UP offered you something you didn't like. Sometimes I wonder what would happen if you had chosen the course over the school you loved. But all of that is in the past, just like the good and bad moments we shared. The future is right in front of us and we decide how it goes. We may not talk as much now, but I gotta be honest, I really thought we still had something. At least, you made it feel that way. So, understandably, I was surprised when within the week where we last saw each other again in UPD, you were seeing someone new. You could have told me while we were walking around the sunken garden as the sun was setting. But you didn't. You may have been protecting me from knowing, but I guess that just shows how far we have drifted apart. I guess I am now free. I'm free from the idea that we may still have a chance. Free from loving you. And for the future, I wish you the best. For the present, I wish you strength. For the past, for all the laughs we shared, for the endless calls we made, for the long walks we talked all the way through, for the tears we cried, I thank you. We grew a lot in the past three years, and I could not imagine those years without you. So, thank you.
